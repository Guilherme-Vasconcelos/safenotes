Prerequisites for using Safenotes:

1. It is only guaranteed to work on GNU/Linux environments. I have
not been able to test it on Windows or Mac OS, so I cannot assure you that
it works. If problems occur, feel free to open an issue or pull request, but
I will probably not be able to test it if it is related to a different
operating system.

2. You need GPG (GNU Privacy Guard), since it is the software used for encrypting
and decrypting the files. If you are using a GNU/Linux distribution, you probably
already have it installed, but you can test it with the command: `gpg --version`.
