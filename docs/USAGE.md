### Safenotes for the first time

In order to run Safenotes, you must use the command: `python3 safenotes.py`

If it is your first time using Safenotes, it will ask you to define a password.
Make sure you pick a password you will remember, because recovering it is not
possible without losing access to your notes.

You can choose anything to be your password, but it is recommended
that it is at least 16 characters long.
